# Media-Manager
Manage your images, music tracks and other medias and files in a more simpler way

# Version
This projects is the first version and developed in 2002. But I still find it helpful.

# What is Media Manager
This project called Media Manager and is a kind of explorer with a built in list in which you can push files and medias. it gives you a preview not only for the images and pictures but also for songs and MP3s. so you can create a list from your images , Songs, MP3s and files and save , open and do actions based on this list.

For example, imagine you have a lots of images in different folders and you want to create a selection from some of images in a new folder. You can easily go through your images in different folders and create a list of images that you wish to copy or move to a new folder or delete. you can save your list and continue your selectioon on an other day. Finally, when you review all the folders you can move, delete or copy your list to a new location. This is helpful specially if you are selecting songs among hundreds of tracks on your computer. It prevents from opening each picture or song individually and do copy/paste for selected items within same folder.
